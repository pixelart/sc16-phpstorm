PhpStorm Settings
=================

Recover
-------

If you don't worked out all settings you can add
`https://github.com/pixelart/sc16-phpstorm-settings` to File -> Settings ->
Tools -> Settings Repository as read only url and restart your PhpStorm.

Now all your settings should be in sync for the workshop.
