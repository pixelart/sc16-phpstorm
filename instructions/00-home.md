### Welcome to the PhpStorm workshop!

A) Start up the virtual machine!

B) In the virtual machine, open a terminal and change into the summercamp folder

```bash
cd ~/summercamp/
```

C) Run the installation script, even if you have done it before at home!

```bash
./run.sh phpstorm
```

D) Finally you should be able to go to `http://phpstorm.phpsc/` and create
your first bolt user to finish the workshop playground.
